The goal is to build a rudimentary testing suite to automate tasks normally performed on TestPad by QA Engineers at MPC.


Setup:

- install Cypress v. 13.6.4

- clone this repo

- ask Finn Jacobs or Anneika Weeks for env file


To Run Tests:

- after setup, run `npx cypress open`


If you need help troubleshooting or have questions please reach out to Finn Jacobs or Anneika Weeks


Notes to those regularly using running test from this repo:

- With testIsolation set to false in cypress.config.js, clearing cache and refreshing browser is necessary between test runs
